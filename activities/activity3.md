# Activity 3

1. Discuss definitions of the outputs of the programs `noOnString`, `noOnSelf` (similar to the `yesOnString` example from page 34).
2. If the programs `noOnSelf` and `notYesOnSelf` existed, would they be equivalent programs?
3. Can `noOnSelf` exist? If it cannot, prove it. If it can, write it!
4. Exercise 3.3
