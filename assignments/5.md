# Assignment 5

1. Consider the language $A$ consisting of all strings in $a$ and $b$ with at least as many $a$s as $b$s, and the language $B$ consisting of strings in $a$ and $b$ with at most as many $a$s as $b$s. Show that these languages are context-free languages by constructing CFGs for them.
2. Construct a CFG for the language $L=\{a^ib^jc^k \mid i=j\textrm{ or }j=k\}$.
3. Show by construction why:
    i. the union of two CFGs is a CFG.
    ii. the Kleene star of a CFG is a CFG.
    iii. the concatenation of two CFGs is a CFG.
4. For the three grammars in examples 1 and 2, and using the technique described in class/the notes/the book, construct equivalent grammars that are in Chomsky Normal Form.
