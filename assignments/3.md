# Assignment 3

This assignment focuses on DFAs. The file `dfa_test.ml` in the `ocaml` folder can help write tests for your answers.

1. Suppose we consider the alphabet 0, 1 and the corresponding strings are then binary numbers, which we see highest-order bit first. Consider the language $L = \{w \mid \textrm{the number }w\textrm{ is divisible by } 5\}$. Draw a DFA with $5$ states that recognizes this language.

2. Consider the alphabet consisting of the characters `a` and `b`, and the language $L$ containing exactly the strings that consist of $0$ or more `a`s followed by $0$ or more `b`s. Draw the DFA that recognizes this language, explaining what the different states "represent" ($3$ states are sufficient).

3. Consider the alphabet consisting of the characters `a`, `b` and `c`, and the language $L$ containing exactly the strings that contain a `aa` and a `bb` (in either order and potentially far from each other). Draw the DFA that recognizes this language, explaining what the different states "represent" ($7$ states are sufficient).

4. Consider the alphabet consisting of all 10 decimal digits, and the three symbols `+`, `-`, `.`. The language $L$ consists of all valid numbers, according to the following rules:
    - The first character may be a sign `+` or `-`.
    - A sign cannot appear anywhere else in the number.
    - After the possible sign, a number follows (the integer part).
    - It may be `0` alone, or it may be a non-zero digit, followed by zero or more digits.
    - After the "integer part", there may be a dot, `.`.
    - Following the dot, there may be any number of digits.
    - It is also possible that the number starts with (a possible sign then) a dot, followed by at least one digit.

    For example here are some valid numbers: `-0.`, `+.0`, `.230`, `143`, `0.21`, `-110.`. And some invalid numbers: `+0+`, `-.`, `011`, `1.23.1`.

    Find a DFA that recognizes this language ($7$ states are sufficient). You can use something like `1-9` to indicate a range of "inputs" that should all take you to the same state.
