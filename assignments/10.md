# Assignment 10

In the following questions answering a "True or False" always requires providing a proof or a counter-example, as appropriate.

1. True or False: If $A\leq_m B$ and $B$ is co-Turing-recognizable, then $A$ is also co-Turing-recognizable.
2. True or False: If $A\leq_m B$ and $A$ is decidable, then $B$ is also decidable.
3. True or False: If $A\leq_m B$ and $A$ is Turing-recognizable, then $B$ is also Turing-recognizable.
4. True or False: If $A\leq_m B$, for some languages $A$, $B$, then we must also have $B\leq_m A$.
5. Consider the language $J$ consisting of all strings $0w$ where $w\in A_\textrm{TM}$ and $1w$ where $w\in \overline{A_\textrm{TM}}$.
    a. Show that $A_\textrm{TM}\leq_m J$ and $\overline{A_\textrm{TM}}\leq_m J$.
    b. Use this information to show that $J$ is neither Turing-recognizable nor co-Turing-recognizable.
6. In this problem we address a number of questions related to having a language be mapping-reducible to its complement.
    a. Show that $A_\textrm{DFA}\leq_m \overline{A_\textrm{DFA}}$.
    b. Show that if $B\leq_m \bar{B}$, then $B$ is Turing-recognizable if and only if it is co-Turing-recognizable.
    c. Show that if $B\leq_m \bar{B}$ and $B$ is undecidable, then $B$ is neither Turing-recognizable nor co-Turing-recognizable.
    d. Give an example of an undecidable language $B$ such that $B\leq_m\bar{B}$.
