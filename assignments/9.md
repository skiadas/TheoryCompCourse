# Assignment 9

In the following problems, the statement "determine the complexity of the language ..." means to determine for that language if it is: a. decidable, b. Turing-recognizable but not decidable, c. co-Turing-recognizable but not decidable, d. neither Turing-recognizable nor co-Turing-recognizable.

1. Consider the language $\textrm{ALL}_\textrm{DFA}$ consisting of the string representations of all DFAs $D$ such that $L(D) = \Sigma^*$ is the language of all strings in the alphabet (the alphabet defined by that $D$). Determine the complexity of this language.
2. Consider the language $L = \left\{\langle M, N\rangle\mid M,N\textrm{ are TMs and }L(M) \cap L(N) = \emptyset \right\}$. Determine the complexity of this language.
3. Consider the language $L = \left\{\langle M, w\rangle\mid M\textrm{ is TM and does not halt on }w\right\}$. Determine the complexity of this language.
4. Consider the language $L = \left\{\langle M\mid M\textrm{ is TM and }L(M)\textrm{ is decidable} \right\}$. Determine the complexity of this language. (Note: $L(M)$ being decidable is not the same as saying $M$ is a decider)
