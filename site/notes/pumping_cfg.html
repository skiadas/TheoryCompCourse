<h2 id="the-pumping-lemma-for-context-free-languages">The pumping lemma for context-free languages</h2>
<p>The pumping lemma for context-free languages is a bit more complicated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pumping Lemma for CFLs</strong></p>
<p>If A is a context-free language, then there is a number <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, so that any string <span class="math">\(s\in A\)</span> of length at least <span class="math">\(p\)</span> may be divided into <span class="math">\(5\)</span> pieces <span class="math">\(s=uvxyz\)</span> so that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math">\(uv^ixy^iz\in A\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(i\geq 0\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math">\(|vy|\geq 0\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math">\(|vxy|\leq p\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So instead of having a single piece that can be pumped, it has two pieces that are “pumped together”. Condition 2 says that at least one of the strings <span class="math">\(v,y\)</span> is non-empty.</p>
<h3 id="proof-of-the-pumping-lemma">Proof of the pumping lemma</h3>
<p>The proof involves thinking about the parse tree for a string. For such a parse tree, we want to consider paths from the head (start nonterminal) to the different “leaves” (terminals). The <em>length</em> of such a path is the number of “edges” (so a path of length 3 will contain a total of 4 symbols along the way).</p>
<p>The following result is obtained by using a standard counting argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the depth of the parse tree (the largest length of a path in the tree) is <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and the largest number of items that can occur in the right hand side of a production rule in the grammar is <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, then the generated string has at most <span class="math">\(b^p\)</span> terminals.</p>
<p>Conversely, if a string has length more than <span class="math">\(b^p\)</span>, then there must be a path in the parse tree of length more than <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows somewhat simply: The production rules tell us how many children each node can have. so the start node can have at most <span class="math">\(b\)</span> child nodes. Each of these can have at most <span class="math">\(b\)</span> child nodes, for a total of <span class="math">\(b^2\)</span> nodes possible at depth 2. Continuing this logic, there are at most <span class="math">\(b^k\)</span> nodes at depth <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we proceed with the proof of the pumping lemma. For the rest, we denote by <span class="math">\(b\)</span> the largest number of symbols used on the right hand side of a production rule, and by <span class="math">\(q\)</span> the number of nonterminals. Then consider <span class="math">\(p=b^{q+1}\)</span>. This will be the pumping length.</p>
<p>Suppose now that we have a string of length at least <span class="math">\(p &gt; b^q + 1\)</span>. By our previous observation, there must be some path that has length at least <span class="math">\(q+1\)</span>. This means that it contains at least <span class="math">\(q+2\)</span> elements in total, so at least <span class="math">\(q+1\)</span> elements if we exclude the leaf element.</p>
<p>Now all these elements along the way must be non-terminals, as they are the only ones that can appear in a non-leaf position. So we have at least <span class="math">\(q+1\)</span> non-terminals down that path. Since there are only <span class="math">\(q\)</span> distinct non-terminals in the language, it must be the case that two elements down that list are the same nonterminal, <span class="math">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we think of the derivations that correspond to this parse tree. We must have first a derivation <span class="math">\[S \Rightarrow^* uRz\]</span> where we’ve expanded all other derivation steps except the one with top node the first occurence of <span class="math">\(R\)</span> (and those below it). Now if we expand the derivation that has at its top this <span class="math">\(R\)</span>, it produces another <span class="math">\(R\)</span> somewhere inside it, so there is some derivation: <span class="math">\[R \Rightarrow^* vRy\]</span> Finally, the inner <span class="math">\(R\)</span> also has a certain derivation that results in a string <span class="math">\(x\)</span>: <span class="math">\[R \Rightarrow^* x\]</span></p>
<p>The normal derivation of the string <span class="math">\(s\)</span> we started would then be the combination of these: <span class="math">\[S \Rightarrow^* uRz \Rightarrow^* uvRyz \Rightarrow^* uvxyz\]</span> so <span class="math">\(s=uvxyz\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can see now how we could pump such a string: By omitting or repeating the step <span class="math">\[R \Rightarrow^* vRy\]</span> any number of times. This is the source of the pumping, that <span class="math">\(R\)</span> can produce itself with some extras on either side. The resulting strings are exactly of the form <span class="math">\(uv^ixy^iz\)</span>.</p>
<p>What is left is to determine the other conditions in the lemma, regarding the lengths of <span class="math">\(vy\)</span> and <span class="math">\(vxy\)</span>. For that we need to have made some choices along the way carefully:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we choose the parse tree to be the smallest possible out of all parse trees that would have derived that string in our grammar.</li>
<li>Second, we choose the longest path in the tree instead of any long enough path.</li>
<li>Third, we must choose our <span class="math">\(R\)</span> carefully. In particular, we need to choose it amongst the bottom <span class="math">\(q+2\)</span> elements in the path (we know that’s already too many elements to go by without duplication).</li>
</ul>
<p>The second and third conditions together guarantee that the parse tree that sits below the chosen “outer” <span class="math">\(R\)</span> has depth at most <span class="math">\(q+1\)</span>, and hence has in total at most <span class="math">\(b^{q+1}=p\)</span> terminals at the resulting derived string. Since the derived string is <span class="math">\(vxy\)</span>, that string has length at most <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, proving the third condition in the pumping lemma.</p>
<p>Lastly, we need to consider the second condition in the pumping lemma. If the length of <span class="math">\(vy\)</span> was 0, i.e. if both <span class="math">\(v\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> were empty, then the derivation from the “outer” <span class="math">\(R\)</span> to the “inner” <span class="math">\(R\)</span> would end up being <span class="math">\(R\Rightarrow^* R\)</span> (e.g. other non-terminals in the rules along the way became <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>s). But in that case we could replace the tree for the outer <span class="math">\(R\)</span> with the tree for the inner <span class="math">\(R\)</span>, and obtain an overall smaller tree that still derives the string <span class="math">\(s\)</span>. This contradicts our first assumption above. Therefore the length of <span class="math">\(vy\)</span> must be non-zero, and this completes the proof of the pumping lemma.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-non-context-free-languages">Examples of non-context-free languages</h3>
<p>We can use the pumping lemma to conclude that a number of languages are not context-free.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The language <span class="math">\(B=\left\{ a^nb^nc^n\mid n\geq 0 \right\}\)</span> is not context-free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This should now be a familiar pattern. Suppose that <span class="math">\(B\)</span> was context-free, and hence there is a CFG generating it. Let <span class="math">\(p\)</span> be the pumping length, and consider the string <span class="math">\(s=a^pb^pc^p\in B\)</span>. We will show that it cannot be pumped.</p>
<p>The pumping lemma guarantees that we can write <span class="math">\(s=uvxyz\)</span> where <span class="math">\(|vxy|\leq p\)</span>. Therefore this part cannot contain both <span class="math">\(a\)</span>s and <span class="math">\(c\)</span>s, as it is not long enough to cross over the <span class="math">\(b\)</span>s. It may also consist of only <span class="math">\(b\)</span>s.</p>
<p>This means that <span class="math">\(uv^2xy^2z\in B\)</span> has either have the same number of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>s or the same number of <span class="math">\(c\)</span>s, while one of the other symbols’ count goes up. This is a contradiction.</p>
<p>Let us look at another example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The language <span class="math">\(C=\left\{ a^ib^jc^k\mid 0\leq i\leq j\leq k \right\}\)</span> is not context-free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is similar, we look at the string <span class="math">\(s=a^pb^pc^p\)</span> as above, where <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is the pumping length. As before, <span class="math">\(vxy\)</span> must either contain no <span class="math">\(c\)</span>s or contain no <span class="math">\(a\)</span>s.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it contains no <span class="math">\(c\)</span>s, then <span class="math">\(uv^2xy^2z\in C\)</span> has more than <span class="math">\(p\)</span> copies of either <span class="math">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, which contradicts the <span class="math">\(i,j\leq k\)</span> assumption.</li>
<li>If it contains no <span class="math">\(a\)</span>s, then we look at <span class="math">\(uxz\in C\)</span>, which has less than <span class="math">\(p\)</span> copies of either <span class="math">\(b\)</span> or <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, which contradicts the <span class="math">\(i\leq j,k\)</span> assumption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The language <span class="math">\(D=\left\{ww\mid w\in\{0,1\}^*\right\}\)</span> is not context-free.</p>
<p>Constrast this with the language of palindromes: <span class="math">\(\left\{ww^R\mid w\in\{0,1\}^*\right\}\)</span>, which is context-free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is instructive to think first for a second where the pumping lemma would break down for palindromes. In fact the palindrome grammar is simple:</p>
<pre><code>S -&gt; aSa | bSb | cSc | ... | eps</code></pre>
<p>The nonterminal <span class="math">\(R\)</span> in the proof of the pumping lemma would be <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, and it always appears symmetrically in the middle. Repeating or removing that middle part does not break the pattern.</p>
<p>Now let us show that our language <span class="math">\(D\)</span> above is not context-free. If it were, and if <span class="math">\(p\)</span> was its pumping length, then consider the string <span class="math">\(s=0^p1^p0^p1^p\)</span> and how it would break into parts <span class="math">\(s=uvxyz\)</span>. No matter how we arrange it, the strings <span class="math">\(v,y\)</span> will contain <span class="math">\(0\)</span>s from one of the sections but not the other, or <span class="math">\(1\)</span>s from one of the sections but not the other. In either case, replacing <span class="math">\(vxy\)</span> with just <span class="math">\(x\)</span> results in a string of the form <span class="math">\(0^kq^l0^sq^m\)</span> where either <span class="math">\(k\neq s\)</span> or <span class="math">\(l\neq m\)</span>. It is certainly not a repetition of a string.</p>
