<h2 id="non-regular-languages-1">Non-regular Languages</h2>
<p>It is important to understand the limitations of any system we use, and this includes finite automata. So a natural question there is: Can we easily say if a language is regular or not?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A language is called <strong>non-regular</strong>, if there is no DFA/NFA that recognizes it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how can we tell if a language is non-regular? We can show a language is regular by providing a DFA/NFA for it, but we cannot say a language is non-regular simply because we have not been able to find a DFA for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our inability to find a proof for a statement is not a proof that the statement is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We therefore need something more concrete. But before we do that, let us state a question that we will return to at a later time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a process/algorithm/method, which given a language can determine if that language is regular or non-regular?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s attempt a partial answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we perhaps go through each DFA out there, in some order (we can probably order them in some way starting by size) and try each DFA to see if it matches the language?
<ul>
<li>First problem: If the language is not finite, we don’t really even have a way to make sure that the DFA matches it.</li>
<li>Second problem: If the language is non-regular, we would have to check every DFA in existence, and there are infinitely many of them. So we would never terminate.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Let us leave it at that for now.</p>
<p>But let us exemplify some of our difficulties with the following two examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The language <span class="math display">\[C = \left\{w\mid w\textrm{ has equal number of 0s and 1s }\right\}\]</span> is not regular. But the language <span class="math display">\[D = \left\{w\mid w\textrm{ has equal number of 01s and 10s }\right\}\]</span> in fact is regular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take a moment to ponder why that is.</p>
<h2 id="the-pumping-lemma-for-regular-languages">The Pumping Lemma for regular languages</h2>
<p>In this section we will establish a nice relatively easy-to-test requirement for a language to be regular. This would allow us to exhibit many languages as non-regular. It is known as the <em>pumping lemma</em>. It essentially says that if the language has a string of a certain length, then we can produce infinitely many strings of a certain form that must also be in the language.</p>
<p>In this section we will make extensive use of the notation <span class="math inline">\(|x|\)</span> to denote the length of the string <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pumping Lemma</strong> for regular languages.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a regular language, then there is a number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, called the <strong>pumping length</strong>, so that if <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is any string in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> with length at least <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then we can break <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in three parts as <span class="math display">\[s = xyz\]</span> so that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>for each <span class="math inline">\(i\geq 0\)</span> we have that <span class="math inline">\(xy^iz\in A\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(|y| &gt; 0\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is nonempty),</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s the idea of the proof:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a regular langauge, there is some DFA that recognizes the language. Let’s say that it has <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> states.</li>
<li>We start on state <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, and as we trace the string <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> through the DFA we must pass through at least <span class="math inline">\(p+1\)</span> states (including the start state).</li>
<li>But there are only <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> distinct states, so it must be the case that as we trace the string <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> through the DFA, it passes through the same state at two distinct instances.</li>
<li>Looking at the points at which this occurs is what allows us to break the string up into the three parts <span class="math inline">\(xyz\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> gets us to that repeated state for the first time, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> does a loop and takes us back to that state, then <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> continues to the end.</li>
<li>Then we can use any number of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>s, and they would just amount to us doing more loops at that state, or no loop at all. In any case we can continue with the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> part to arrive at a final state. So all the strings <span class="math inline">\(xy^iz\)</span> are in the language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us look at a formal proof:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let <span class="math inline">\(M=(Q,\Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span> be a DFA that recognizes the language <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be the size of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>.</li>
<li>Let <span class="math inline">\(s=s_1s_2\cdots s_n\)</span> be a string in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(n\geq p\)</span>.</li>
<li>Since <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> recognizes the string, there are states <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span>, , <span class="math inline">\(r_n\)</span> such that:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(r_0 = q_0\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(r_{i+1} = \delta(r_i, s_{i+1})\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i=0,\ldots,n-1\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(r_n\in F\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span>’s, and only <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> distinct states, so some <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> must be the same. Let us say the first one of these is <span class="math inline">\(r_j\)</span>, and the next one is <span class="math inline">\(r_l\)</span> (there might be more, we pick the last). Note that <span class="math inline">\(l\leq p+1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Let <span class="math inline">\(x=s_1s_2\cdots s_{j-1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y=s_j\cdots s_{l-1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(z = s_l\cdots s_n\)</span>. Then of course <span class="math inline">\(w=xyz\)</span>.</li>
<li>We observe that <span class="math inline">\(xz\)</span> would also be accepted by the automaton, using the states <span class="math inline">\(r_0,\ldots,r_{j-1},r_j=r_l,r_{l+1},\ldots, r_n\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(xy^2z\)</span> would be accepted, using the states <span class="math inline">\(r_0,\ldots,r_j,\ldots,r_l=r_j,r_{j+1},\ldots, r_l,r_{l+1},\ldots,r_n\)</span>.</li>
<li>Similarly the strings <span class="math inline">\(xy^iz\)</span> would be accepted, by repeating the strings <span class="math inline">\(r_{j+1},\ldots,r_l\)</span> an appropriate number of times.</li>
<li>It is clear that <span class="math inline">\(|y|&gt;0\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(|xy| = l-1 \leq p\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question: Can it happen that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is empty? Can they both be empty?</p>
<h3 id="using-the-pumping-lemma">Using the pumping lemma</h3>
<p>Let us see how the pumping lemma can help us show that a language is non-regular. As an example we will take the language <span class="math inline">\(A=\{ 0^n1^n\mid n\geq 0 \}\)</span> described earlier. The idea applies in many situations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> was regular. Then it would have a pumping length <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</li>
<li>Consider an appropriate string from the language. In this case we will consider the string <span class="math inline">\(s=0^p1^p\)</span>.</li>
<li>Apply the pumping lemma: This string <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(s=xyz\)</span> with the aforementioned conditions.</li>
<li>The condition <span class="math inline">\(|xy|\leq p\)</span> can help us say something about <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. In this case <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> must consist of all zeros.</li>
<li>The fact that the strings <span class="math inline">\(xy^iz\)</span> must all be in the language usually leads to a contradiction now. In our case, <span class="math inline">\(xy^2z\)</span> has more zeros than <span class="math inline">\(xyz\)</span>, but the same number of ones. That is not possible given that <span class="math inline">\(xy^z\)</span> is supposed to also be in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</li>
<li>The fact that we arrived at a contradiction tells us that the language <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> must not be regular.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the exact same proof can be used also for the language <span class="math inline">\(C = \left\{w\mid w\textrm{ has equal number of 0s and 1s }\right\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The book has a lot of excellent examples. Study them!</p>
