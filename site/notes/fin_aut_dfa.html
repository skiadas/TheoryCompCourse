<h1 id="finite-automata">Finite Automata</h1>
<p>In this section we start our formal investigations into various models of computation, starting with one of the simplest forms: finite automata.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Sections 1.1</p>
<p>Practice problems (page 83): 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.12, 1.36, 1.37</p>
<h2 id="finite-automata-1">Finite Automata</h2>
<h3 id="examples-and-state-diagrams">Examples and State Diagrams</h3>
<p>The idea of a finite automaton is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have some number of “states” that you can be in.</li>
<li>There is some state you start from.</li>
<li>Then on each input there’s a specific state you go to. And you forget everything about what happened before.</li>
<li>When you run out of input, you look at the state you are in, and see if it is one of the select few states that would be considered “final”.</li>
</ul>
<p>We usually represent finite automata via a <strong>state diagram</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the <em>state diagram</em> for a finite automaton, you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>One “circle” for each state.</li>
<li>For each state arrows going out to other states, with a label on the arrows indicating the inputs for which they are applicable.</li>
<li>An arrow coming from nowhere indicates the <em>start state</em>.</li>
<li>An extra circle around a state indicates it is an <em>accept state</em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example, let us think of inputs being binary numbers (only <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> as digits), and we want a finite automaton that detects if the number is divisible by <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. Recall that a number is divisible by <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> if and only if the sum of its digits are. Since we see the digits one at a time, we will keep track of the remainder on division by <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> at each stage. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will have 3 states, one for remainder <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, one for remainder <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and one for remainder <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.</li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> state is the start state.</li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> state is also the only accept state.</li>
<li>From each state we have an arrow to itself, for input <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>For input <code>1</code> we have arrows from state <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to state <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, from state <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to state <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and from state <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> to state <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now as practice for you: Suppose we want a finite automaton that detects division by <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. We can still do it by keeping track of the remainder, but some changes would need to be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>We now have <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> states, corresponding to the remainders <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>.</li>
<li>If we are at a state <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, meaning the remainder of our current number when divided by <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, then we need to figure out what happens when we add one more digit. This is easy to do because of the properties of modular arithmetic, and because we can describe the effect of adding one more digit to the number: The number is doubled, and increased by the digit we are adding.</li>
<li>So for example if we are at state <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, meaning the remainder is now <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, then on an input <code>0</code> we got to state <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> and on input <code>1</code> we go to state <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</li>
<li>Similarly if we are at state <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, then because <span class="math inline">\(2\times 5 = 3 \mod 7\)</span> we would be going to state <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> on input <code>0</code> and to state <code>4</code> on input <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exercise 1.37 asks you to generalize this idea.</p>
<p>Another practice problem: Describe an automaton that takes as input a string of a’s and b’s, and accepts only those strings where no letter appears twice in a row.</p>
<h3 id="formal-definitions">Formal Definitions</h3>
<p>Eventually we want to have clear unambiguous definitions, so here is a more precise definition of finite automata:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>(Deterministic) Finite Automaton</strong> (DFA) is a <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\((Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is a finite set, called the <em>states</em>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is a finite set, called the <em>alphabet</em>,</li>
<li>There is a function <span class="math inline">\(\delta\colon Q\times \Sigma \to Q\)</span> called the <em>transition function</em>,</li>
<li>There is a special state, <span class="math inline">\(q_0\in Q\)</span> called the <em>start state</em>, (in particular <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> must be nonempty)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(F\subset Q\)</span> is the set of <em>accept or final states</em> (possibly empty)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 1: What happens if <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is the empty set? What if <span class="math inline">\(F = S\)</span>?</p>
<p>Question 2: Use this formal definition to describe the automaton for division by <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> that we described earlier.</p>
<p>Question 3: Do the same for the automaton for division by <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now discuss the meaning of computation in this setting. Informally we compute as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We start at the start state.</li>
<li>We also have a string from <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>. We want to see if the DFA will accept it.</li>
<li>We go through each letter in the string in order, and use the <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> function to transition to a new state each time.</li>
<li>When we run out of input, we see if we are at an accept/final state. If so then we “accept” the string.</li>
</ul>
<p>More formally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span> is a DFA.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(w=w_1w_2\cdots w_n\)</span> is a string, where each <span class="math inline">\(w_i\in\Sigma\)</span>, then we say that the DFA <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> <strong>accepts</strong> the string <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> if there is a sequence of states <span class="math inline">\(r_0,\ldots,r_n\)</span> such that:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(r_0 = q_0\)</span> is the start state</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\delta(r_i, w_{i+1}) = r_{i+1}\)</span>, i.e. each new input moves us to the next state</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(r_n\in F\)</span>, i.e. the last state is in the special subset of accept states.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We say that the DFA <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> <strong>recognizes</strong> the language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, and we write <span class="math inline">\(L(M) = L\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> accepts exactly those strings that are in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</li>
<li>A language is called a <strong>regular language</strong> if there is a DFA that recognizes it.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that there might be many DFAs all recognizing the same language. But for a given DFA there is exactly one language it recognizes, namely the language of all strings in <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> that the DFA accepts.</p>
<p>Practice problem: Construct DFAs (including writing out the formal definition) for the following languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The language containing no strings at all.</li>
<li>The language containing all strings.</li>
<li>The language containing exactly the empty string.</li>
<li>The language containing exactly one string, namely <code>&quot;a&quot;</code>, where ‘a’ is a specific letter in the alphabet.</li>
<li>The language containing all strings <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;a&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;aa&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;aaa&quot;</code>, and so on (including the empty string).</li>
<li>The language containing all strings <code>&quot;a&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;aa&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;aaa&quot;</code>, and so on (excluding the empty string).</li>
</ul>
<p>Practice problem: If we have the DFA for a language, what would the DFA for the “complement” language be?</p>
<h3 id="the-union-of-regular-languages">The Union of Regular Languages</h3>
<p>Regularity of a language (i.e. having a DFA that recognizes it) is preserved under a number of operations. In this section we will focus on the union:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> are two regular languages, then their union <span class="math inline">\(A_1 \cup A_2\)</span> is also regular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this section we will prove this theorem.</p>
<ul>
<li>We start with assuming that <span class="math inline">\(M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2, q_2, F_2)\)</span> are DFAs that recognize the languages <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> respectively (these exist since those languages are regular).</li>
<li>We will construct a new DFA, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, which recognizes the union <span class="math inline">\(A_1\cup A_2\)</span>.</li>
<li>The idea is this: <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> will “simulate” following both <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>. At any stage we try to make progress towards both automata, and at the end we’ll be able to see if one of the automata can accept.</li>
<li>Now we proceed with the details. For a new automaton we need to define a 5-tuple: <span class="math inline">\((Q, \Sigma, \delta, q, F)\)</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> will be the cartesian product <span class="math inline">\(Q_1 \times Q_2\)</span>. In other words a state in the new automaton is a pair <span class="math inline">\((q, q&#39;)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(q\in Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q&#39;\in Q_2\)</span> are states from the two DFAs respectively (Some states in <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> might end up being not reachable, but we don’t care about that).</li>
<li><p>The transition function <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> uses <span class="math inline">\(\delta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta_2\)</span>:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\delta\left((q, q&#39;), a\right) = \left(\delta_1(q, a), \delta_2(q&#39;, a)\right)\]</span></li>
<li>The start state is the pair of start states, <span class="math inline">\((q_1, q_2)\)</span>.</li>
<li><p>The final states <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are those that are final for <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F = \left\{(q, q&#39;) \mid q\in F_1\textrm{ or }q&#39;\in F_2\right\}\]</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What do you think about the intersection of regular languages?</p>
<p>The concatenation of regular languages, as well as the kleene star of a regular language, are regular, but this fact will be harder to prove, and it will be a consequence of further work we will do with non-deterministic automata and regular expressions.</p>
