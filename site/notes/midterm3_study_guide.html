<p>This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of everything you need to know, but it is a good starting place.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the formal definition of a <strong>Turing machine</strong>?</li>
<li>Describe what a <strong>configuration</strong> for a Turing machine is.</li>
<li>What are the possible outcomes of running a Turing machine on some input?</li>
<li>When do we say a language is Turing-recognizable?</li>
<li>When do we say that a language is decidable?</li>
<li>Describe in fairly low detail Turing machines that decide “simple” problems (e.g. some regular languages or CFGs).</li>
<li>What is a multi-tape Turing machine?</li>
<li>Describe how we can simulate a multi-tape Turing machine with a single-tape Turing machine.</li>
<li>What is a non-deterministic Turing machine?</li>
<li>Describe how we can simulate a non-deterministic Turing machine via a multi-tape Turing machine.</li>
<li>Describe how the string representation of a graph might be.</li>
<li>Describe how the string representation of a Turing machine might be.</li>
<li>Describe the acceptance, empty language and equivalent languages problems for DFAs, and show that the corresponding languages are decidable.</li>
<li>Describe the acceptance, empty language and equivalent languages problems for CFGs. Show that the acceptance and empty language problems are decidable.</li>
<li>Describe the languages <span class="math">\(A_\textrm{TM}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\textrm{HALT}_\textrm{TM}\)</span>. Show that they are undecidable (this is effectively the Halting Problem question).</li>
<li>Show that if a language is both Turing-recognizable and co-Turing-recognizable, then it is decidable.</li>
<li>Show that <span class="math">\(E_\textrm{TM}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\textrm{EQ}_\textrm{TM}\)</span> are undecidable.</li>
<li>Define the concept of mapping reducibility and computable functions.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(A\leq_m B\)</span>, what statements can be made about when the decidability/undecidablity/Turing-recognizability/non-Turing-recognizability and so on of one language implies the same for the other?</li>
<li>Show that <span class="math">\(\textrm{EQ}_\textrm{TM}\)</span> is neither Turing-recognizable and co-Turing-recognizable.</li>
<li>How do we define the time complexity of a decidable Turing-machine?</li>
<li>What is the time complexity class <span class="math">\(\textrm{TIME}(t(n))\)</span>.</li>
<li>What is the class <span class="math">\(P\)</span>? Show examples of languages that are in <span class="math">\(P\)</span>.</li>
<li>What is the class <span class="math">\(NP\)</span>? Show examples of languages that are in <span class="math">\(NP\)</span>.</li>
<li>Define polynomial-time reducibility.</li>
<li>What problems are called <span class="math">\(NP\)</span>-complete?</li>
<li>Describe the problems SAT, 3SAT, CLIQUE, VERTEX-COVER, HAMPATH, 3COLOR, SUBSET-SUM.</li>
<li>State the Cook-Levin theorem. Explain its significance.</li>
<li>Show that 3SAT is polynomial time reducible to CLIQUE as well as to VERTEX-COVER. Use this to show these are NP-complete.</li>
